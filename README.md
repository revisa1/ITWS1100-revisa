As a college freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, aspiring to enter the Information Technology field in Management, I am passionate about utilizing my analytical and technology skills to organize, manage, and design data efficiently. With a strong foundation in mathematics, computer science, and problem-solving skills, I am eager to learn and apply my knowledge to drive both technical and business operations forward.

I have excellent communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills that will help bridge the connection between my technical knowledge and business performance. Through my extensive dance experience, dancing on stage in front of hundreds of unkown people makes public speaking and presentation look easy. My High School and College education have prepared me well to enter the workforce, I am excited to embark on this career path and create a lasting positive impact on the World!
