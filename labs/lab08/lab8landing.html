      <h1>Lab 8 - JavaScript, JSON and AJAX</h1>
      <p>In lab 3 we made a website which consisted of a homepage (index.html) and a projects page.
         Since then we have been adding projects to that page for each lab.</p>
      <!-- <p>You also made edits to your website during your quizzes and throughout the semester.</p> -->
      <p>Well, here we go again. We are going to modify the projects page we created in that lab again, but this time in
         a different way.</p>

      In this lab,
      <ul>
         <li>You are to make a JSON file with a list of your project menu items<br />
            <p class="minor">I have provided a <a href="lab8jsontemplate.json"><strong>JSON template</strong></a>
               to get you started.<br /><br />
               I have also provided <a href="Oldlab7/lab7 solved.html"><strong>sample</strong></a> of Lab 7 from a
               previous year as an example of how to use AJAX to read a file</p>
         </li>
         <li>The file should contain the information necessary for you to be able to build the appropriate HTML for your
            projects page.</li>
         <li>You are to write some JavaScript to read that file and create your projects menu dynamically for your
            website.
            <p class="minor">Your javascript file <strong><em>must</em></strong> be external to your HTML file.</p>
            <p class="minor">Your jQuery must be served from a CDN of your choosing</p>
         </li>
         <li>when the projects page is loaded, it should read the json file and build your site dynamically</li>
         <li>Add some jQuery or jQueryUI to <em>Jazz-up</em> your website</li>
      </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="minor side2">
      <!-- <p class="noteThis">In order to test this file with Chrome when the website is loaded on your PC/Mac,
        you will need to run this from your localhost by starting your webserver and making sure the content is located on your local webserver (www/iit, htdocs/iit, etc)</p>
      <p>The reason for this has to do with the Same Origin Policy protection discused in class</p>
      <p>Also note that if you are using Brackets or VSCode Live Server, you may be able to test this in the integrated browser from them without running it from your local webserver.</p>
      </div> -->
      <!-- <p>While it may work with the command arguments discussed previously, you will not need these flags when running your site from your local AMP or RCS deployment.</p> -->
      <p class="noteThis">Before you begin,
      <ul>
         <li>You are to work in your iit repos for this lab</li>
         <li>Create an issue in your GitHub issues describing what you need to do for lab 8</li>
         <li>Create a new branch in your repo named lab8</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="noteThis">When you are done,
      <ul>
         <li>Commit your updated iit folder to your GitHub repo</li>
         <li>Merge your branch back into main on GitHub</li>
         <li>Close out your issue on GitHub</li>
         <li>Pull your changes down to your website and verify that all is working, then stop your server</li>
         <li>Do <em>not</em> forget your README file, and make sure to include you GitHub and Azure links
         </li>
         <li>Post a link to your repo on LMS</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You will be graded according to the following criteria:
         <a href="lab8rubric.txt">Lab 8 Rubric</a>
      </p>
      <p>NOTE: Going forward through the end of this semester and forward you will be able to simply add records into
         the JSON file and have your menu be updated accordingly without have to again edit your projects page.
      </p>
